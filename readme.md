## About

I'm following along with the exercises from Wes Bos' [JavaScript30](http://javascript30.com).

As tempting as it is, I'm not going to use any libraries, frameworks or build steps. Just vanilla JavaScript. That means that:

* the exercises will sometimes only run in a [modern browser](http://browsehappy.com/), (but I've only tested in the latest version of Chrome so YMMV) and
* my code doesn't always follow the conventions set by [some](https://vuejs.org/) [popular](https://facebook.github.io/react/) [frameworks](http://emberjs.com/).

While I've aimed to keep my code tidy and readable, I'm not spending a lot of time on refactoring since I don't think it's the point of the exercise.
